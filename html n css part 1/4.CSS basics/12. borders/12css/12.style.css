  # --> there are two types of gradient[ linear-gradient, radial-gradient]
        Radial creates a circular pattern  
  # --> its better to create 'gradient' from website. 
  # --> to use gradient, we'll use the 'bvackground' property.
        instead of the 'background-color'.
  # --> good site for gradient  [ https://cssgradient.io/ ]
